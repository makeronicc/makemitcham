    <h1>MakeMitcham</h1>
    MakeMitcham is the new Makeroni event being held with Mitcham Library in their Art space which is a great little space to get together in and Make. For the first few months of meet-ups, we'll be looking at the basics of getting going with a Raspberry Pi Pico and the BBC Microbit. We're open for all comers from 12 and up. So if you want to learn how to make an LED blink or something super clever, do come along. If you have your own laptop, bring it along so you can take your makings home, but we will have access to various bits of kit, and we have the Pi Picos and Microbits.
    <h2>When</h2>
    Next event is on Saturday 20th of October 2024 from 1pm to 4pm.
    <h2>Where</h2>
    Artspace, Mitcham Library
