    <h1>MakeMitcham</h1>
    MakeMitcham is a popup digital makerspace aimed at teens and adults who want to learn more about making
    and creating with electronic and software. We’re a friendly space where you can bring your questions, 
    projects and ideas and find out what you need to know, and how you can learn it. From Raspberry Pi and 
    microcontrollers, to creating the code to go behind a website. If you just want some hands on time, 
    we have laptops and microbits (and help available) for you, or if you just want to be inspired, we’ll 
    have guest projects for you to check out.
